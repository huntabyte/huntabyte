I'm an engineer who loves to learn and build things that others find useful. I've been working with tech professionally for almost 9 years, but as a hobby for over 15.

I'm also passionate about sharing what I learn with others. You can find some of my content on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@huntabyte).
