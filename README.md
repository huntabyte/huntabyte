Welcome to my GitHub page. Most of the public projects here are open source contributions, practice projects (to learn a new language or framework), or  resources/projects built for my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/huntabyte). Most projects that I am actively working on are private, some of which will be publicized once I believe the time is right.

## About Me

I'm a Network & Systems Engineer turned Software Engineer. I love the fact once you learn software development, the possibilities to create great things are endless. I haven't made the full commitment to a single language yet, but I am currently heavily invested in learning Svelte/SvelteKit, and have spent a bit of time using Python & NodeJS.
